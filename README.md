“Food” is not only a necessity in our life but also an important part of the society. Exploring locally-owned cuisines has already become popular around the world, and holding family reunions in lovely restaurants is a tradition for many of us. Although the outbreak of Covid-19 suddenly suspended this routine and greatly changed the way we savor different types of gourmet outside, the constant increase of vaccination coverage rate gives us the hope to see our life back to normal. Which place would you like to eat after the pandemic?  Seeing this issue from the seller's side, how should restaurants get prepared for a normal future? To answer this question, analyzing the data right before the pandemic can be useful, since it pictures the trend of restaurant business which is very likely to be continued when our society gets back to normal track.
